/**Functions in Javascript - Functions are the main "building blocks" of the program
 * They allow the code to be called many times without repetition.
 * We've alr seen examples of built-in functions, like alert(message)
 * But we can create functions of our own as well.
 *
 * Therefore in Javascript, functions are blocks of code that can be defined and called
 * to perform a specific task.
 *
 * --------------------Function Declarations----------------
 * Function declarations define a named function using the function keyword.
 *
 * Syntax
 *      function Functionname(){
 *
 *      }
 *
 */

      //examples

function showMessage(){
    alert("Hello everyone");
}
/**
 * In the example above, The fuction keyword goes first, then goes the name of the function,
 * then a list of parameters between the parantheses (comma-separated, empty in the example above,
 * we'll see the examples later) and finally the code of the function, also named "the function body",
 * between curly brackets.
 *
 *              function name(parameter1, parameter2, ......parameterN) {
 *              body
 *              }

-> In the example above to display the message "Hello Everyone" we just have to call the function
name as seen below
